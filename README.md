# LMPRNGCart
UCLA EE3 Final Project
----
This project was very similar to the IEEE OPS Final Project. However, it was more of a NatCar style project. It also focused (hardware aspect) on using L239D H Bridge for motor control, 9V battery to power motors, arduino nano as primary microcontroller, but used breadboards instead to read and interpret IR Values, and added an LED and Halls Effect Sensor to detect magnets (light up LED if a magnet is detected). It also used PID (software aspect) and PWM (read the OPS project caption for information on that). More information about the details can be found in the link (part of list) above.

--I should note that I didn't actually pass on competition day.
